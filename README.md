Hello World Tutorial for GitHub

Hi everybody!

My name's Tommy and I'm an Epidemiologist at the Lincoln-Lancaster County HD. We're working on some modeling and need to become more familiar with GitHub to understand the work being done by the Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation. This is just another thing we're adding to our schedules out of necessity for dealing with COVID-19.
